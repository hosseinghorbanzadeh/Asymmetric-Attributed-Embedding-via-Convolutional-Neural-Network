# Asymmetric-Attributed-Embedding-via-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This is the implementation code of "Learning Asymmetric Embedding for Attributed Networks via Convolutional Neural Network" article for cora dataset .

Which includes tasks :Visualization,reconstruction,Link Prediction,node classification

This code has been executed and tested in google colab

In folder methode, the implementation of the proposed method and other methods are available

In this work, Python programming language is used and networkx,stellargraph,numpy,pandas,tensorflow,keras,matplotlib libraries are used
